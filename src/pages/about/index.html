							纬图设计机构创立于2005年，名字取自于“经天纬地”之说，意为根植于大地、倾听每一块土地的呼吸与诉求的愿望，编织生活的美好蓝图。
							纬图强调有机的设计，不过分强调设计者的自我愿景，而是将场域的原生面貌，视为设计的起源，不预设立场，经由考虑土地的纹理脉络，调动每一处活性元素，让空间生命力盎然滋长，
							让景观与人、景、地融为一体，有机生长。尊重自然、尊重这片土地及在此生活的人，并承担景观的使命——疗愈人，疗愈土地，用设计传递善意与爱。

							Weitu Design Agency was founded in 2005, and its name is taken from the saying "Jingtianweidi", which means the 
							desire to be rooted in the earth, listen to the breath and appeal of every piece of land, and weave a beautiful blueprint for life.
							Witto emphasizes organic design, but does not overemphasize the designer's self-vision, but regards the original appearance of the field as the origin of the design, 
							without prescribing a position, and mobilizing every active element by considering the texture and context of the land. Let the vitality of the space flourish, and let the landscape integrate with people, landscape, and ground, and grow organically. Respect nature, respect this land and the people living here, 
							and undertake the mission of landscape-heal people, heal the land, and convey goodwill and love through design.
